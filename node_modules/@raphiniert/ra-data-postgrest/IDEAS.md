Here's a list of customizations that I have implemented locally in an old local version of ra-data-postgrest. The gaps in the numbers means it has already been imlemented in master. My customizations are relatively low quality and without tests. I thought I'd leave it here with you for inspiration or maybe it has overlap with one of the thins you want to work on.
- 1: Allowing calls like dataProvider.getOne('rpc/xxx') that actually returns a single object
- 6: column filtering voor getOne en getMany
- 8: Be able to use useGetOne with an array of ids for rpc/xxx functions
- 8b: Be able to use useGetMany with an array of ids for rpc/xxx functions
- 9: Be able to use useGetList with rpc functions (that return a list)
- 10: we could do null valued parameters, but undefined valued paramters do not make sense to pass to Postgrest
- 11: be able to filter on an array of values (and use 'in' operator by default)
- 12: be able to sort on multiple fields
- 13: with calls to getOne using rpc functions do not use eq.xxx but simply xxx
- 17: Allow a null response with getManyReference instead of an empty array (because that's what som of my rpcs return)
Some might be so niche that you should ignore them and that I instead should actually implement in a decorator (a function that alters the params a bit before the dataprovider function is called)


About the decorator. Not sure if know how to use it, but I use it like this:
```jsx
import { CreateParams, DataProvider } from 'react-admin';

/**
 * Gives opportunity to alter method, resource and params before calling the original dataProvider
 */
export const decorator = (dataProvider: DataProvider) => ({
	...dataProvider,
	create: (originalResource: string, originalParams: CreateParams) => {
		const method = 'create';

		const newParams = {
			...originalParams,
			// alterations
		}

		return dataProvider[method](originalResource, newParams);
	},
});
```

And then to use it.
```jsx
const restClient = postgrestRestProvider(
    httpClientApi,
    defaultListOp,
    resourcePimaryKeys
);

export const dataProvider = decorator(restClient);
```
